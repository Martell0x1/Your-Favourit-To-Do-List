It's a very basic To-do list Application made with wxWidgets framework.

## How Does It Works
It Just Loading the data from the text file and display them on the window , please notice that these data must follow some rules
1. first  : Task Id (It's automatically generated by the system)
2. second : Task's string (This is the Task text ie: Do your homeworks)
3. third  : Task's Expiration Date , express when is the deadline of the task (ie. 12/11/2024)
4. fourth : Taks's Status , express weither the Task is Compeleted Or not

## Why
The reason of doing that project that i'm trying to achieve a goal , which is making # of projects in this summer as a practical practice on the OO concepts.
